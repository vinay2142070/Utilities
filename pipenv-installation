1. Install Python 3.8
Installing Python is much like installing any other program: go to their website, download the software, install it.

Below this guide, we have an archived guide using homebrew and virtualenv for installation.

1. Go to python.org/downloads/mac-osx

2. Under Stable Releases look for: Python 3.8.X and replace X with the largest number you can find. Under that, click the link to download the macOS 64-bit installer

3. After the installer downloads, open it, and install all the defaults.

4. Verify Installation: - Open up Terminal in (Applications/Utilities/Terminal) - Verify the version from above by typing:

```
python3.8 -V
```
Does the result match the stable release you downloaded? Great. Continue.
2. Install Pipenv Globally
1. Open Terminal in (Applications/Utilities/Terminal) and upgrade pip:

```
python3.8 -m pip install pip --upgrade
```
Another option to upgade, is `pip3 install pip --upgrade`
2. Install Pipenv:

```
python3.8 -m pip install pipenv
```

Another option to upgade, is `pip3 install pipenv --upgrade`
3. Verify Pipenv:

```
pipenv
```
If you see `zsh: command not found: pipenv` then you did the wrong installation.
3. Create Virtual Environment with Pipenv
1. Open Terminal in (Applications/Utilities/Terminal)

2. Make Dev directory:

```
mkdir Dev
```
You only have to do this 1 time
3. Create an empty directory (aka folder) for your project inside ~/Dev folder:

```
mkdir ~/Dev/cfehome
```
4. Initialize the Virtual Environment:

```
cd ~/Dev/cfehome
pipenv install --python 3.8
```
5. Activate the Virtual Environment:

```
pipenv shell
```
You can use the command `deactivate` to end your virtual environment.
